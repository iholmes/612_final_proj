I created a set of functions that take in starting parameters for a Lotka-Volterra model of two microbes growing and competing in one host, and return the expected average population size of the two microbes after a user-identified number of host generations. Each microbe has an intrinsic rate of increase (the rate at which they would breed absent of any resource competition), a carrying capacity within the host, and a degree to which the population of the other microbe affects their growth rate. I also allow the user to set the number of hosts available to the microbe, and the number of generations the microbes undergo per host generation. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n.host <- 100
hostMat <- matrix(NA, nrow=n.host, ncol=2)


hostMat[,1] <- runif(100, 0, 1)

hostMat[,2] <- 1-hostMat[,1]

n.mic.gen <- 10

# number of offspring per generation

nOff1 <- 2
nOff2 <- 20

# starting population size

micStart <- 1e3
micK <- 1e5

# interaction term
alpha12 <- 0.5
alpha21 <- 0.05

internalLV.show <- function(vector){
  
  tmp <- matrix(NA, nrow=10, ncol=2)
  tmp[1,1] <- vector[1]*micStart
  tmp[1,2] <- vector[2]*micStart
  
  
  for(i in 2:10){
    tmp[i,1] <-tmp[i-1,1]*(exp(nOff1*(1-(tmp[i-1,1]+alpha12*tmp[i-1,2])/micK)))
    
    tmp[i,2] <-tmp[i-1,2]*(exp(nOff1*(1-(tmp[i-1,2]+alpha21*tmp[i-1,1])/micK)))
  }
  return(tmp)
}

show <- internalLV.show(c(0.5, 0.5))

plot(x=1:10, y=seq(0, 112100, 112100/9), type="n", xlab="time step", ylab="population")
lines(show[,1], col="blue")
lines(show[,2], col="red")

```
